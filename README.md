## Overview
Snakes-Cafe is a terminal based restaurant project allows customers to input what they want and receive their order back from an output in the terminal.

## Getting Started
In order to run this app on your own machine I would go to my github account at @LutherMckeiver and then to the repo named snakes-cafe.

After clone down to your machine. And cd into the project and run in via python3.
$ python3 snakes_cafe.py

## Architecture
In this project I am using python 3.

## API
In this app the only thing you are inputting is the food you would like to order from the restaurant, and the output will be your order back from the terminal.
